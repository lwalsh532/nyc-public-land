# Vacant Lots in NYC Map Description
 I collected data from 596 Acres that holds all of the locations of vacant lots across NYC. I downloaded the data as a GeoJSON, and uploaded it to my Github for this week's assignment.

I used the "show and hide layers" mapbox tutorial.
Attached below is the link to the tutorial.

I experiences some difficulty with this tutorial. I used it to create a toggle for vacant lots, which I plan to do as a part of my final project. However, when attempting to move the code around to js, css, and html, I ran into a lot of errors. When keeping the entire code in HTML, it worked well. I will definitely need to troubleshoot this for my final though. 

I made additions to the code by differentiating the vacant lots by public or private land through color coding. 

I added a sidebar to describe the map along with the toggle button to turn the vacant lands on and off. I hope to learn for my final project how I could turn on public land/private land dots within the same dataset as well.
